                <strong>Roses.</strong>
                <p>Rose. The symbolism of love and commonly gifted to your lover.
                <P> If I could mutate one of the rose and create a new flower</P>
                <p> I would make it so that it never wither,</P>
                <p> During a thunderous storm it'll hold on its own well</p>
                <p> Even if it's placed in a bad soil, it will still strive.</p>
                <p> It's going to bloom forever, as long as the sun doesn't die.</p>
                <p> That's how my love is to you.</p>

                <strong>Love letter.</strong>
                <p>You get a lot of these from me every sunday but it wouldn't be me if I didn't write especially in Valentines day</p>
                <p>My love. I'm glad to have you coming out of no where in my life, You're something I thought didn't needed when I in fact did.</p>
                <p>And it would be really cool if you became my first valentine's, I turned down this day a lot and saved up for someone special.</p>
                <p>My gambling sense has waited for you to be chosen, and i have 1 question WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU MY WHOLE LIFE??? at least send me a signal that you comin or something.</p>
                <p>While I was waiting for you to come, the younger me had prepared you a message for when you finally found me. (I'm sorry abt whatever the young dumb me wrote)</p>

                <p>/Februbary 14 2022/ " My Love if i can even call you that i wonder what i did to get you to like this fuckhead, i hope you arent paid to do this</p>
                <p>if you are held against your will, then umm gtfo now. Anyways youre the one for me right? I must've love you dearly, if i love you, i love you too.</p>
                <p>i got some questions to ask. the time you spent with me do you think you the one for me? and am i the one for you. is it forever with eachother</p>
                <p>or is it months later and we already gone. pls be mindful about me. if you really like me then holy shit </p>
                <p>i wish i knew your name so that i can make sure to treat you as nice as possible and like enjoy eachother anyways I love you [i̶n̶s̶e̶r̶t̶ ̶n̶a̶m̶e̶] [Rey.]"</p>

                <p>I didnt want to show you this because it was REALLY EMBARASSING</p>
                <p>yk I thought it would be cool to let you know abt this history? I did have partner to do this with before you but they werent interested</p>
                <p>Anyways enough of that. You know it means so much to me for you to be my first proper valentine partner and it would be better if will forever be my valentine's partner, I'm sorry if I'm late for the valentine day.</p>
                <p>but I think we can have our own valentine day here where we aren't busy and spend time as much as possible having our moments.</p>

                <strong>Sweets.</strong>
                <p>I wish I could send you all the chocolate that i rarely eat in my fridge.</p>
                <p>But I have a feeling that the sky pirates will take over the transport plane</p>
                <p>and steal all the sweets that could've sent to you</p>
                <p>Haha, yk i'm bullshitting i dont know how to transport anything to your place</p>
                <p>and so it still won't stop me from making gifts for you like this.</p>
                <p>anyways. Sweets? I sadly couldnt send you sweets but I wished you could taste what you see.</p>
                <p>Cause you could maybe taste something in whatever I made here</p>
                <p>I predict you'd taste a 'low quality cat explosion' or Ink... </p>
                <p>Ima put a picture of food so that you can taste something else other than explosive cat or ink</p>
